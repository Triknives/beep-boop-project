#_Beep Boop Project

#### This project takes numbers provided by a user, and returns sounds associated to specific conditions. 11/1/2019

#### By _**Brett Cordell**

## Description
This application is designed to take a user input, specifically a numeric value and return the number in a number line form, along with "beeps" and "boops" in place of values where conditions set apply (see below)._

_Specs:
* This program takes a users number, then returns a range of numbers starting from 0 to the users inputted number. Once the input has been received, it will be put through several "filters" or "rules" that will then change numbers based on the applied rules below.

* Example input: "5"  Output without rules applied: "0,1,2,3,4,5".
* Example input: "5"  Output with rules applied: "0,Beep,Boop,Sorry,4,5".
* Rules of output: 3 conditions will be assessed throughout the user's input.
They are:
* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Sorry"

Example of expected behaviors / outputs:
* The number 13 should be replaced with "Sorry"
* The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
* The number 32 should be replaced with "Sorry."
