## Description
_This application is designed to take a user input, specifically a numeric value and return the number in a number line form, along with "beeps" and "boops" in place of values where conditions set apply (see below)._

_Specs:
* This program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the users inputted number.
* Example input: "5"  Output: "0,1,2,4,5"
*Rules of output: 3 conditions will be assessed throughout the user's input.
They are:
